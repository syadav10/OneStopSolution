                  <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Businesses are often under intense cost and time constraints and find it difficult to take complete control over their critical finance processes. One such process is bookkeeping, which keeps a track of total earnings and expenses of a company. Efficient bookkeeping services provide a clear picture of total earnings and help in taking important business decisions that take the company forward. Having an in-house bookkeeping & accountancy team can be cumbersome and expensive.</p> 
                    <p>It is better to outsource bookkeeping services to an experienced third-party service provider. One Stop Solutions has been providing top-quality professional accounting and bookkeeping services in India to clients around the world. We take care of all your accounting and tax preparation processes and also provide efficient bookkeeping services at reasonable rates.</p>

                                        <p>Good and Service Tax is the largest Indirect tax reform in India which is going to impact the way business is carried out at pan India level. It’s going to replace almost all the existing Indirect tax or levies like Excise Duty, Service Tax, VAT, Entry Tax etc. Its impact will vary across the different kind of businesses.</p>
                                        <p>Dual GST structure enhances the overall complexity which can be mitigated through a robust IT system. It’s imperative and high time for companies to gear up and assess the likely impact of GST on their kind of business.</p>
                                        <p>Old age concepts like “Sale”, “Manufacturing”, “Stock Transfer” needs to be unlearned and new terms like “Destination”, “Consumption”, “Place of supply” to be learned.
                                            Now, almost whole India will be one market, breaking the boundaries of erstwhile State specific indirect taxes.</p>
